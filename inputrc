# Make Tab autocompletion case-insensitive (cd ~/dow<Tab> => cd ~/Downloads/)
set completion-ignore-case on

# When autocompleting symlinks to directories, immediately add a trailing "/"
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Immediately show all possible completions
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Show extra file information when completing, like ls -F does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after the cursor. For example, when the current
# line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd ~/src/mozillail",
# but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing them like $'\0123\0456'
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off
